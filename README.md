# BioMetrix: DNA Animation

## Project Overview

BioMetrix is a web-based application that visualizes the dynamic growth of neurological biometric DNA strands through animation. Users can control the animation, including playback and speed settings, while learning about the biological parameters that influence the DNA's structure. This project serves as an educational tool to help users understand complex biological concepts in an engaging format.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd biometrix
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` or `animation.html` file in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage

- Open the `animation.html` file in a supported web browser.
- Use the **Play** and **Pause** buttons to control the animation.
- Adjust the **Animation Speed** using the slider control.
- Click the **Reset** button to restart the animation.
- Explore the information section to learn about the animation and the concept it represents.

## Features

- Interactive DNA strand animation that responds to user controls.
- Speed adjustment capability to view the animation at various rates.
- Informational section that provides insights into the biological concepts being visualized.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the UI.

These dependencies are linked via CDN in the HTML files. No additional installation is required.
